# Gitfolio
Gitfolio is an easy to use portfolio builder where you can create a portfolio page automatically by just providing your GitHub username. It is built using Nuxt.js and Vuetify. But it's not necessary to have knowledge on these to get you started. You can make your own copy with zero coding experience.

# Installation
- Fork repo: Click [here](https://github.com/MehdiRtal/Gitfolio/fork) to fork the repo so you have your own project to customize. A "fork" is a copy of a repository.
- Rename repo:
 - If you want to host your portfolio at https://<USERNAME>.github.io, rename your forked repository to username.github.io in GitHub, where username is your GitHub username (or organization name).
 - If you want to host your portfolio at https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO> (e.g. https://<USERNAME>.github.io/portfolio), rename your forked repository to <REPO> (e.g. portfolio) in GitHub.
